# Community Health files
These are the community health files for all of the Cod-related projects.
These are files such as our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codmf/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [issue templates](https://github.com/codmf/.github/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
These files make it easier to maintain our projects by providing a set of rules, instructions, and templates to ease the process of maintenance and contribution.

The files in this repository are documented by [this document](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
Further information about how to contribute to this repository or what the files mean can be found on [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/).
