# Community Health files
These are the community health files for all of the Cod-related projects.
These are files such as our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codmf/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [issue templates](https://github.com/codmf/.github/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
These files make it easier to maintain our projects by providing a set of rules, instructions, and templates to ease the process of maintenance and contribution.

The files in this repository are documented by [this document](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
Further information about how to contribute to this repository or what the files mean can be found on [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/).

The information provided in this repository is meant to be general for the most part.
The goal is to provide complete documentation for any and every project, but that simply is not possible.
Rather, this information is a general guideline that always applies to all of our projects.
Should the information for any project need to be extended, that project can define its own files while providing reference to the corresponding files in this repository.

An example `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in a Cod project that extends these files could look like this:

```markdown
# Contributing

## Notice
The information in this file is an extension of the [Cod Contribution Guide](https://github.com/codmf/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Everything that is stated in the Cod Contribution Guide applies to this repository, as well as everything stated in this file.
